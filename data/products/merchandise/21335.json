  "description": "Let your creativity shine as you build this LEGO® Ideas Motorized Lighthouse (21335) model. It features a lighthouse tower with motorized rotating light and custom-designed Fresnel lens elements, plus a cottage with a glowing fireplace. The cottage and tower are both easily accessible to let you view the wonderfully detailed interiors, and they sit on a brick-built rocky outcrop with steps down to the pier and a cave containing pirate’s treasure. Lighthouse keeper and sailor minifigures, plus a buildable rowboat and seagull and cat figures, add to the delightful scene.",
